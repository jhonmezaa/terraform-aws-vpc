# Example terraform.tfvars for AWS Outposts VPC
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values
# This example demonstrates AWS Outposts integration

# Note: Most variables have defaults in main.tf
# Override any values here as needed

# REQUIRED: Uncomment and configure these for Outposts
# You must have an AWS Outpost deployed in your account

# Example: Outpost configuration
# outpost_subnets = ["10.9.100.0/24"]
# outpost_arn = "arn:aws:outposts:us-east-1:123456789012:outpost/op-1234567890abcdef0"

# Get your Outpost ARN from:
# aws outposts list-outposts --region us-east-1 --query 'Outposts[*].[OutpostId,OutpostArn]'

# Example: Customize cloud subnets
# vpc_cidr_block = "10.9.0.0/16"

# public_subnets = [
#   "10.9.1.0/24",
# ]

# private_subnets = [
#   "10.9.11.0/24",
# ]

# Example: Additional tags
# tags = {
#   Environment = "production"
#   Outposts    = "enabled"
#   Team        = "edge-computing"
#   Location    = "datacenter-1"
# }

# Important notes:
# 1. Outpost subnets must be in the same AZ as the Outpost
# 2. Outpost subnet size depends on your Outpost capacity
# 3. Local Gateway (LGW) is automatically created for Outpost
# 4. You may need additional configuration for Local Gateway routes

# After deployment:
# - Verify Outpost subnet in AWS Console
# - Check Local Gateway Route Table
# - Test connectivity from Outpost to cloud subnets
