# Example terraform.tfvars for Secondary CIDRs VPC
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values
# This example demonstrates VPC expansion with secondary CIDR blocks

# Note: Most variables have defaults in main.tf
# Override any values here as needed

# Example: Customize primary CIDR
# vpc_cidr_block = "10.6.0.0/16"

# Example: Adjust secondary CIDRs
# Ensure they don't overlap with existing networks
# secondary_cidr_blocks = [
#   "10.7.0.0/16",
#   "10.8.0.0/16",
#   "10.9.0.0/16",  # Add a third block if needed
# ]

# Example: Customize primary CIDR subnets
# public_subnets = [
#   "10.6.1.0/24",
#   "10.6.2.0/24",
#   "10.6.3.0/24",
# ]

# private_subnets = [
#   "10.6.11.0/24",
#   "10.6.12.0/24",
#   "10.6.13.0/24",
# ]

# Note: To use secondary CIDRs for subnets, you would need to:
# 1. Apply this configuration first
# 2. Then manually create subnets in the secondary CIDR ranges
# 3. Or extend the module to support secondary_public_subnets, etc.

# Example: Additional tags
# tags = {
#   Environment = "production"
#   Feature     = "secondary-cidrs"
#   Team        = "networking"
#   Expansion   = "true"
# }

# Planning considerations:
# - AWS allows up to 5 CIDR blocks per VPC
# - Secondary CIDRs must be from RFC 1918 ranges:
#   - 10.0.0.0/8
#   - 172.16.0.0/12
#   - 192.168.0.0/16
# - They cannot overlap with existing VPC peering connections
# - Route table size limits may apply with many CIDRs
